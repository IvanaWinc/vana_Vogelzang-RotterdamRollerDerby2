        <h1 class="h1">Get involved</h1>
        Our new skater sessions take place every week on Saturday
        from 10.00 to 12.00 and are open to everyone,
        whether you’re an experienced skater or if you’ve never put skates on in your life.
        When you start out you don’t need any equipment as it will be all provided for the first couple of
        trainings.
        Our doors are open, just drop us an email so we know what gear we need to reserve for you.
        No experience necessary, but it is of course an advantage! We’ll teach
        you all the skills you’ll need to skate and fall safely.
        Don’t worry about fitness level either, roller derby is a great way to get in
        shape and most of our skaters started without playing sports, ever before.

        <h1 class="h1">A-team: Rotterdam Death Row Honeys</h1>
        The Rotterdam Death Row Honeys are fanatic athletes. They train hard for their place in the
        international rankings. You can find our rankings at Flat track stats.
        <h1 class="h1">Rotterdam Killer Bees</h1>
        For the Bees being able to play equalizes fun. In July 2014 they played
        their first scrimmage against rival Amsterdam and are growing ever since.
        Some stay, some move up to the A-team.

        Want to keep skaters safe and make sure we are behaving? Want to know all
        about the rules? Don’t like to get hit? Become a Rofficial! Officials are
        often known as team “no fun”, but you can’t say that about our Rofficials!
        Of course they train to keep a straight face when they are calling our penalties,
        but they are also known to be quite fun during our joint scrimmage training
        and travel all over Europe to officiate games at other leagues.

        If you’re totally new to skating and roller derby, we will first teach
        you the basics. While you’re learning, you’re in a group with others who
        are new. We call this group our ‘Juvies’ and try to teach you all we know
        before you join a team.
